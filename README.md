"When I was a child, I thought like a child"

The projects in this repository are tasks I had to work on while training with Stutern. 
A complete novice with a lot of enthusiasm. 
Some are messed up, I know. I'll keep them because, I can look back on them and say I have grown.

I know the process because my skills were processed.
And I know the journey, because I walked it.

Smiles.
